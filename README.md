<p> ResQ: Smart Disaster Relief Management System
ResQ is an advanced disaster relief management system designed to coordinate and streamline emergency response efforts during natural and man-made disasters. Built with real-time data integration, AI-powered analytics, and community engagement tools, ResQ serves as a centralized hub for government agencies, NGOs, first responders, and affected communities.

🚨 Core Features:
Real-Time Monitoring
ResQ integrates data from satellites, weather services, and on-ground sensors to track disasters like floods, wildfires, earthquakes, or cyclones as they unfold. It provides a live dashboard with alerts, maps, and severity indexes.

Resource Allocation Engine
Using AI, ResQ intelligently matches available resources—like food, water, medical supplies, and volunteers—to affected areas based on urgency, accessibility, and logistics.

Multi-Agency Coordination
ResQ supports seamless communication between rescue teams, local authorities, healthcare services, and NGOs, minimizing duplication and maximizing impact.

Crowdsourced Reporting
A mobile app allows citizens to report incidents, request help, and share location-tagged photos or videos. This grassroots input helps responders pinpoint hotspots more accurately.

Relief Tracking & Transparency
The system tracks every stage of relief distribution—what’s sent, where it’s going, and when it arrives—ensuring transparency and accountability.

Offline Support
Even in areas with limited connectivity, ResQ’s mobile modules can operate in offline mode and sync data once a connection is restored.

🌐 Use Cases:
Post-earthquake search and rescue in urban zones

Coordinated flood relief in rural regions

Managing aid in refugee camps

Wildfire evacuation planning and alerts

🔒 Security & Resilience
ResQ is designed with cybersecurity best practices, data encryption, and redundancy across cloud and edge servers, ensuring that the system stays online even when local infrastructure fails.</p>
